# Discontinued Sponsors Dashboard

Hello, below are saved some datas linked to
my GitHub sponsors dashboard.
It was mainly a loss of time.
I did a closing request in April 2024,
and it was confirmed in May 2024.

I would like to tell some things first.
Current state of free-software in my mind
is that it serves mainly the goal of powers
of distinct communities,
unrelated to free-software,
including state agencies.
For example, how do you explain that
most current OSes don't have out of the box
features like:

- a clip-board manager: Ctrl-Shift-V,
  seriously is there anybody out there
  doing great things with a computer that
  does not need such a feature at least
  part of the time,
  everytime you have to download a small
  executable
  (B.I.: Backdoor Included? or just Beacon Included?)
  when you want this feature;
- reading Linux partitions on Windows
  (maybe it changed recently),
  I say this because I had a new computer hacked
  on SourceForge a few years ago while searching
  for such a solution.
- etc.

Another fun fact:
When I was a PhD student, my third PhD advisor told me:
"Ne donne pas le bâton pour te faire battre."
"Don't give the stick to be beaten with."
Because I had voluntarily done a presentation of my work:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397509006252
Partitionnement d'hypergraphes.
Réunion MAO, ENS Lyon, avril 2005.
https://lyaudet.eu/laurent/communications.html
to talk about ordonnancing with chalk on black board XD.
Mind my intent: I did not want to give a stick,
I was fed up by some teachers reading powerpoints,
and I liked the idea to have a single sheet of notes
to do a full presentation at the black board.
At this time, I had a state of mind like:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcjWy1oAKzo
I have this state of mind more or less often
in various periods of my life.
And I was like:
"Ok, if someone is thinking it is ok to beat someone
just because there is a stick somewhere,
then it is not a viable form of life.
Moreover, there will always be sticks,
and people can also look and find for some
sticks without you giving them."
Do not waste time culpabilizing:
"Did I gave a stick blabla?".
One of the tricks of the devil
is to make you find a stick and
to wait that you give it to someone or give it back to him/her...
or force you to do so,
"pour faire d'un coup, 2 pierres.".
(One step further, there is
"Should I have crossed the street?",
"Changed dress?", etc.
A little of street life can vaccinate
for wrong prerequisites for something.)
"then it is not a viable form of life.":
kind of extremist, no?
I tried to correct my thinking and avoid to give sticks
(but not closing my mouth all the time)
for a good part of the last 10 years,
spoiler: it changes nothing...
Some people will change their mind and avoid beating you with a stick
after some years, but there is an endless supply of new assholes...
Only God knows if someone will turn back
of his wrong ways at some point.
Clearly, with only one life that's not the case of everyone.
Cherry on the cake is brainwashing, hypnosis, etc.
"Give it back to": mind some "parity problems",
how many ping-pong, billiard strips rebounds?
I keep in mind the ratio in the Bible (50%, 50%),
unless there is a strong proof otherwise,
regarding physical strength (men, women, childs),
there is a strong proof, but that's not the full picture,
mind soldier-children...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_the_military
Unfortunately, most people can not handle this kind of problems,
like children in U.S.S.R. reporting their parents as not communists.
99%, 1% but it exists.
Not only in the military... not only in Africa...
There can be 2 or more victims/pierres.
Mad world.

Since I had a clear goal of not avoiding problems
that I saw,
even if I did not have a clear way of how to act,
I was expecting troubles.
Currently, there are many.
After 2008, it was mainly "Blabla is a spy.",
coming from people that are "respectable citizens...".
Since then, many other BS was added.
My work was sabotaged for years.
I spend a lot of time, not all the time,
reading wrong comments
on my feature requests or bug reports, pull-requests, etc.
Below you will read:
"I'm trying to help the free software community"
I am/was conscious that it sounds suspicious.
Yes it was another stick...
Mind my intent: I wrote it that way just to be frank,
and it was corresponding to my feeling like "The Ugly Duckling".
Because, when I wrote this, I was a professional developper.
Moreover, I already experienced BS feedback in the FOSS community.
Fun fact: I continue...
(to experience BS,
to give sticks mainly by being frank or unintentionally,
in fact since I chose to ignore the risk of giving some sticks,
this is ambiguous;
after some time, you're not that clean anymore,
but then brainwashing, hypnosis, etc. hard to tell;
Always remember "The wolf and the lamb.")

Here is the closing request:
Bonjour,

Je voudrais désactiver ma page Sponsor de GitHub.
Pendant un temps je pensais que peut-être un jour
je vivrais de mon travail sur du code open source.
Maintenant, je pense que ça ne sert à rien,
sauf peut-être à attirer des moqueries,
voire des malédictions si certains attribuent la paternité
de bouts de code à Dieu ou à d'autres personnes,
en mode : Soit c'est l'Esprit qui l'inspire,
soit c'est un espion comme le suggèrent plein d'enfoirés sur ma vie
depuis longtemps, soit c'est le mauvais qui l'inspire.
En gros, difficile de sortir vainqueur sur le plan personnel.

Merci d'avance, bien cordialement,
Laurent Lyaudet

"ou à d'autres personnes": Especially when someone makes my code
disappear and I redo it months or years later.


## Short Bio

I'm trying to help the free software community:
fill bug reports, submit patches,
author of two libraries in C: transliteration_profile_iconv,
and TSODLULS,
author of 3 Python packages: django-monkey-patches,
python-none-objects, etc.


## Long Bio

Hello,

I'm trying to help the free software community.
For this, I fill bug reports, submit patches.
Recently, I saw the possibility of helping by developing
libraries that could be used by others.
At the moment, I am developing two libraries in C:

- transliteration_profile_iconv: a variant of iconv where
  everything is transliteration
  (it opens possibilities
  but at the cost of slower performances)
- TSODLULS for sorting faster than glibc qsort
  (sorting in linear time assuming unit cost ram model).
  This library is the implementation of an article I wrote.
  That article is freely available on arxiv.org.
  (see README.txt)
  The aims of the library are:

  - - prove that sorting several times faster than qsort
      can be achieved for many orders
      (see the benchmarks in the library for a proof of that)
  - - define and develop a language to describe orders (TSODL):
      a first draft is available for language C;
      the goal will be to develop such a language
      for others programming languages too.
  - - provide state of the art sorting algorithms
  - - compile TSODL orders definitions into data preprocessing
      for using state of the art sorting algorithms.

I also develop 3 Python packages:

- django-monkey-patches
  to improve or correct Django's framework,
- python-none-objects to have more elegant Python code
  and maybe one day more performant,
- python-repeatable-iterable to have a type that guaranty that
  you will be able to iterate many times over a collection.
  It can be used to consume once an iterator
  and obtain such a collection.

I have also a repository for dev or sysadmin scripts
and repositories for nano web apps, etc.

I have a PhD in Theoretical Computer Science.
And at the moment, I am a full stack dev at Deleev/LaBelleVie.
I contribute on my free time.

Best regards,
